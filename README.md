# Weather-App

We want to create an application that can give live details about the weather in any location.

Some of the details that we want in the weather are:

1. Temperature (in Celcius)

2. Weather condition (Sunny/Cloudy etc)

3. Wind Speed

4. Humidity

To do this we can create Update a few basic components:

1. An AppBar so that our application name is made prominent.

2. A Search Box where users can type in any location.

3. The text displays the name of the location.

4. A Card to display the details of the weather. Attach a small image of the weather condition as well.

For Error Handling, display an error message if the API request fails or returns an error message

To get weather data about a location we can use openweathermap.org's api endpoint.
